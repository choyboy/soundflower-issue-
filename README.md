# soundflower-issue-
I'm trying to download soundflower on high sierra on my mac so i can use the inbuilt audio on quicktime, however i press install, it fails and comes up with a message saying, 'the installer encounters an error that caused the installation to fail. contact the software manufacturer for assistance', any ideas on how to fix this? any help would be much appreciated.
